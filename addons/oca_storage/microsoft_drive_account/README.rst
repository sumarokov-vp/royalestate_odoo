Configuration
=============

In order to use the Microsoft Drive Account module, you need to set
following configuration parameters in your Odoo instance:

- microsoft_account.auth_endpoint: The URL of the Microsoft
  authentication endpoint. This is usually
  `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your <https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your>`__
  endpoint id}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize.
- microsoft_account.token_endpoint: The URL of the Microsoft token
  endpoint. This is usually
  `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your <https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your>`__
  endpoint id}/oauth2/v2.0/token.
- microsoft_drive_client_id: The client ID of your Microsoft
  application. This is a unique identifier for your application that you
  can obtain from the Azure portal.
- microsoft_drive_client_secret: The client secret of your Microsoft
  application. This is a secret key that you can obtain from the Azure
  portal. It is used to authenticate your application with the Microsoft
  Graph API.

Optionally, you can set the following parameters:

- microsoft_drive_client_scope: The scope of the Microsoft application.
  By default the following scopes are used

  - offline_access
  - openid
  - Files.ReadWrite.All
  - Sites.ReadWrite.All

Usage
=====

On the user preference page, the user can link their Microsoft Drive
account to Odoo by cliking on the Drive button. This will redirect the
user to the Microsoft authentication page, where they can log in and
grant permission to Odoo to access their Drive account. Once the user
has granted permission, they will be redirected back to Odoo, where
their Drive account will be linked.
